## The Team

:point_right: **Group:** _**7**_

:point_right: **Members:**

Our team is composed of 4 people:

* Edwin Autome (_**@AutomeEdwin**_)
* Louis Arys (_**@diomenios**_)
* Anh-Emile Pham (_**@EXSamus**_)
* Filipp Shatskiy (_**@fshatskiy**_)
* Melvin Campos Casares (_**@melvinmajor**_)

## The project

The idea is to try to understand the data in the file and use it to embed the gaze point in the video.
Obviously the movement is very jerky, so we have to try to improve the trajectory of the point (by the use of a filter, interpolation or anything else based on our tests).

To go further, we may try to highlight the areas where the gaze stays longer, either by a circle whose area is proportional to the time during which the gaze is in the area or by a color whose intensity would also be proportional or something else.

### Specifications

We are free to choose the direction we want to take.
There will be no precise specifications ; it's not like the [digital electronics project of 2nd year](https://github.com/melvinmajor/thermopic) where there were clear guidelines.

It is obviously necessary that the quantity and the quality of the provided work are sufficient (example: not just take an existing algorithm of treatment of images)!
The project can use existing libraries but can not be limited to this (personal contribution has to be made).
It is of course necessary to demonstrate the understanding of the operations of the libraries used.

### Programming language, software/API and material used
